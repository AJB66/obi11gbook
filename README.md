Oracle BI 11g Book Artifacts Project
====================================

#Welcome to the Oracle BI 11g Book Artifact Project
This Github location serves as the main location to reference the code files from the Oracle BI 11g book exercises, errata fixes, etc. 

##What's here?
We've tried to list out the core items from the book:
* Database Dump
* Web/Presentation Catalog
* RPD
* Skins/Styles

##Database for the Tennis Data Warehouse
The Tennis DB can be found in a couple of different flavors.  In the folder labeled Tennis_Database, you'll find the:
*Tennis Database DDL File
*Tennis Database HTML Documentation Zip File

We've parked the full-blown Oracle Database Dump of the Tennis DB on the following link for you to download, 
http://aws3.artofbi.com/OBI11gBook/TennisDB.7z

The Tennis Database Dump (.dmp) is an Oracle Database, clearly, and is around 22MB. We use the best compression tool out there, 7-zip, which can be downloaded from http://7-zip.org.  You'll need it to extract the 7z file containing the .dmp file which should result in a 100MB+ file for you to Import (imp) into your Oracle RDMBS.

##Esbase Files
The Oracle Essbase outline and database files are also available for you to download via this link, http://aws3.artofbi.com/OBI11gBook/OBI11gBook_Essbase.zip

##I don't know where to find...
If you've looked here and don't see what you were looking for we'd be interested to know what you after Sherlock.  So head over to the Oracle BI 11g Book forum and drop us a note. We'll try at acquiesce once we hear from you.
